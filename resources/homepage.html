                <h4>Quick Summary</h4>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    Beginning with only a few matches of Unreal Tournament (a classic first-person shooting game), my life with computers evolved from gaming to building to now coding from client side applications to web-based scripts and even dipping into server side data and control.  When I'm free, you'll find me either gaming on my computer or out with a soccer ball and a friend taking shots on each other.  On weekends when I visit home, I like to go out disc golfing with a childhood friend of mine or going bowling with my best lady-friend.  When it comes to work, even on five hours of sleep, I am able to wake up ready for the day and already thinking of what I could do to get my job done.

                    Through high school and into the first year of college, my free time was filled with playing soccer and runing track and cross-country.  I grew up with soccer since the age of six and drew towards the sweeper position (the last line position of the team defense) as I came into school leagues.  When high school Junior Varsity began, I had moved to the mid-field wing positions (players who run the sideline and are both offense and defense) to take advantage of my natural faster running speed and basic ball control.  Come Varsity, I had worked back into the sweeper position for my team and acted as a defensive captain.  Today, I play soccer mainly as a hobby on my down time.  I mosly just pass the ball with a friend or take shots on each other.  For the first year of college, I joined a recreational team just to play games with a team but found that I did not care for the competitive side of the sport anymore but the teams we faced did.  So I left the team to simply enjoy the sport as a fun activity.

                	My track and field life was never very extravagant.  My main races were the 200m dash and the 400m dash.  I mainly remember these as being some of the hardest races to face both physically and mentally.  A quarter mile (400m) and an eighth of a mile (200m) ran full speed with no slowing down or resting.  I may have been fast but these races required a tremendous amount of endurance as well.  Sadly, my performance never matched the Varsity league and I remained on Junior Varsity for my track and field career.  By Junior year of high school, I had injured my knee and had to drop out of track.  I had scans done but sadly, doctors could only say that it was inflamed and nothing else was wrong.  It would seem that "to be unable to jog without needing to sit down from the pain only to later get up and be able to hobble around only" means that it is "inflamed".

                	Cross-country was a sport I had picked up back in middle school but had dropped to switch to track and field by highschool.  After the knee injury, I had was able to recover enough to jog/run long distance so I switched back into cross-country.  I knew it would be a sport that I was simply going to do for fun and sure enough, my performance showed that I was just an average long-distance runner.  It felt great to be able to run a 3.5 mile race in around 22 minuets but man the practice to get to that stage was not easy.  10 mile runs every weekday;come rain or shine.  The team was very supportive of my joining them though.  At first, they laughed that I still tried to run like a sprinter; arms tense and leaning foreward.  Then they kept giving me tips on how to save energy and to keep going on a slower pace.  Arms had to be relaxed and body had to be straight up.  Eyes had to look high and feet had to land gently on the ground.  It took a while to get accustomed to all this but if had paid off.  My best race in cross-country was ran in 16 minuets and 36 seconds.

                     I'm sure the assumptions of what a person in a career of computers are already happening as soon as the header for this secion was read.  I'm also sure that I fit the mold quiet well thus proving that I belong in this field.  As I had menioned in the quick summary, my computer life ranges from gaming to dealing with hardware to now coding for any environment I can.  My first experiences with a computer came from visiting my childhood friend back home as kids and playing Unreal Tournament (classic first person shooter) on his and his brother's computers.  I was already into video games growing up but never knew what the computer had to offer.  Seeing the rush of detailed graphics and having the power of 60 frames per second on a 1680x1050 screen with 60 Hz of refresh rate turned my childhood of TV entertainment on it's head.  It took only one night to realize that I wanted my own computer.  When I went home, I decided to load up some Warcraft III whenever I could.

                	Around my sophmore year of highschool, I decided that it was time for an upgrade to the home computer.  At first, I was only going to buy a pre-built computer.  My friend's brother (older than us and now has a degree in computer support and services) stepped in and convinced me that it would be much better to build my own computer.  So I saved up a good portion of money for my project and was also helped by my dad to pay for the rest of the expenses on a new computer build.  An ATX Full Tower build with an Intel Duo 3.5 GHz CPU, NVIDEA GTX 220 video card, 4 GB of DDR3 RAM, 1 TB HDD, 800w PSU, 1600x900 60Hz refresh rate display, and Logitech mouse and keyboard.  This machine was a beast among computers (for its time).  Using online guides on how to build a computer and with the help of my brother and my dad, we pieced everything togehter (sadly took us about two hours to do...we were new to this).  Later that night, my friend and his brother came over to inspect everything then setup the BIOS and install windows on it.  The first game we loaded up that night was Unreal Tournament 3.

                	My life in coding was introduced around my Junior year of highschool.  I was interested in the other side of the computer world (as compared to the hardware) and wanted to see how all my games and apps were made.  The best my school had to offer with computers was a basic HTML class and two other classes on Microsoft Office.  My brother (at that time, he was in college) introduced me to C++ and showed me an editor called "Bloodshed" which was a basic C++ editor and assembler.  I tinkered around on it and had learned the basic Hello_World code but at the time, my house was still on dial-up (no cable in my neighborhood) and I was not able to take any online classes because videos just do not load at that speed.  So I took what I could through highschool and waited patiently to take college classes on programming.  It first began with Pascal quickly followed by Python.  Once we learned the mechanics of programing, we were dropped right into C++ where I had the hardest time grasping recursion.  Today, I now know C++ and it's more advanced OOP setup as well as Java, Assembly, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Spring, Struts, and Kuali Rice even.
