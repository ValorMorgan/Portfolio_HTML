                	The Kuali Rice Internship was a student programming position at Michigan State University where we were primarily tasked with learning and understanding the Kuali Rice enterprise suit application framework and all required programming knowledge to allow us to develop and improve upon pre-existing functionality for the several departments around the campus.  Of the 12 week internship, 10 weeks were dedicated to in lab learning where we were taught several languages ranging from HTML to Java to SQL.  Within those 10 weeks, each of us 13 interns where given the tasks of developing a strong web precense using HTML, CSS, and any amount of Javascript we needed as well as to form groups of two or three people to work on a Java and SQL campus project that could be proposed to Michigan State University for full univeristy integration.  Each of these projects was improved upon in real time as we learned and practiced new programming techniques and styles.  For the final two weeks of the internship, the internship group was split into groups of two to five people to go work with a department of Michigan State University to improve and implement new systems into their individual Kuali Rice infrastructure.

                	As an IT Intern at Ranir LLC, I was tasked with providing employee technical support for all technological needs ranging from small application updates to complete reformating and replacements of computer  hardware.  Though the job was less focused on programming, much of the work done was focused on the interaction of the IT department with the rest of the business departments.  Cooperation with employees and managers was key for deciding when system improvements, replacements, or removals would take place and at what set amount of time in order to complete each responsibility.  Some larger tasks involved the replacement of an entire department's computer hardware as well as the Ranir warehouse's reboot of local and internet access.  Such tasks as these required the communication with the IT department manager and the department affected as well as myself in order to be informed on the situation and to provide an estimate of required time for completion.

                	Operating the banding machine at Advance Packaging, my job was to keep the transition from warehouse staging to shipping as smooth and fast as possible while maintaining a set standard for quality for each product passed.  Units (bundles of stacked, collapsed boxes) would run down a conveyor belt to the banding station where I had to confirm that the unit was prepared for shipping and to determine the amount of top layer covering as well as the amount of strapping required for safe shipping.  Each unit type required either a cardboard cover or wooden top to compress the unit and protect the quality of the unit.  The number of bands was determined both by the size of the unit and by any customer requests for shipment.  Each unit was tagged and needed to be scanned and cataloged into the network database.  On faster days of production, the speed at which units required inspection, scanning, and covering broke down to a frame of 5 seconds per unit.  On these days, the conveyor belt would not stop and I had to keep pace between the unit, local computer, and bander control panel ina circular and efficent pattern.
