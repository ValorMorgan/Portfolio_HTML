                	One of the first langauges learned, C++ served as my primary language into the world of programming and was what I used to understand the concepts of object oriantated programing (OOP) and memory management.  I began learning very basic C++ in grade school as an interest which evolved to learning the language formally on my first semester of college.  By the second semester, I had learned iterations, recurrsion, basic concepts, and the development of classes and workspaces.  A year following this level of understanding (after taking logic courses), I was taught advance OOP and memory management using UML diagrams to plan out functionality and pointer setups to link classes together.

                	Originally, I looked at this language to expand my knowledge of C++ given that the two langauges are Object Orientated languages and simply use some differing syntax.  Given the work load for C++ projects and the lack of proper training, I put off learning the language until I partook in the Kuali Rice Internship.  As expected while learning the language, the transistion from C++ was very simple and quick for me.  The greatest challenge in the transition was learning how Java took care of most memory management for the developer rather than forcing a destructor to be made.  The original concept and development for the Campus Traffic project for Kuali Rice was made in Java and implemented Derby database access through class functionalities.

                	One of the first langauges formally learned, HTML was offered as a class back in late grade school and had me creating a made-up company website from nothing more than a text document and a browser.  Since then, I put off the language to learn C++ and OOP for more advanced projects.  With the learning of CSS in the Kuali Rice Internship, HTML was implemented once more and used strongly in making this website.  Much of the language remains rather simple compared to others but serves it's functionality for positioning and populating the websites I develope.  The web based portion of the Campus Traffic project was developed using HTML 5 and implemented the Google Map API as well.

                	First learned at the Kuali Rice Internship, CSS became my central resource for styling anything from color and size to positioning and relation to each component on the screen.  Within a matter of one week of learning the language, all "style' HTML tags were removed (unless stricly needed for a component with certain properties) and replaced with stying and id's from a central CSS page.  This language lead to a major improvement on readability and understanding of the page layout.  Removing the central CSS page from this website, for example, would lead to a page devoid of color with text blocks collapsing to the top left of the screen.

                	A mostly self taught feature to improve my portfolio, JQuery became my goto langauge for adding unique functionality to my websites with features such as a universal header and footer page, removing and adding of custom content to a page via a button click, and page animation to slide components around smoothly for visual appeal.  For example, the entirety of my portfolio takes place on one page and only the container that has the content is changing.  Clicking on links calls functions within the JQuery script to empty and load sections of the page, reveal hidden content, and animate sizes and positions of content.

                	Though used scarcely for the time being, I learned SQL in order to have the knowledge of how the departments from the Kuali Rice Internship access their databases and retrieve the needed infromation for their projects as well as insert and change data within the database.  Much of the end SQL work is done by higher administrative personel but the coding to finish projects I worked on required my understanding of this process.  While working on the Campus Traffic project, we created our own Derby dataase using SQL and needed to call commands to the database with strings of SQL code.
