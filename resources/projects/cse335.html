                	For our game the fish will randomly release bubbles that will float upward until they hit the top of the screen and disappear. The bubbles that the player collects will allow them to buy new fish and decorations. A bubble will be released from one of the fish or animated treasure chests after a specified random range of time (around 1-10 seconds). The bubbles collected will be recorded in the reporting window along with last time fed and tank cleanliness. The reporting time will be reduced to every 5 seconds. If the tank gets too dirty the bubbles you have collected will start to go down at a rapid rate. If the bubble count reaches 0 the player loses and receives a dialog box telling them they have failed and that they should be sad, then the program resets. If the fish are not fed after 30 seconds all the fish die and you lose, again receiving a message box that your fish have starved to death because you are a bad person, then the game resets. If you reach 100 bubbles you win, a message box telling you even though you have won the game but you have wasted precious time in your life that you will never get back, then the game resets.
